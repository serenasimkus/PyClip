# PyClip

Made at hackNY Spring 2014 by Serena Simkus and Gabriel Csapo.

The purpose of this app is to allow someone to send the contents of their clipboard to another person easily.

Our plan is to write the app in Python, and use network discovery to make other people on the same network show up, and then allow users to easily send the contents of their clipboard to one of those people.
